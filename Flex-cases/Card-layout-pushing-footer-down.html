	<!--Whether you use flexbox or CSS Grid to lay out a list of card components, these layout methods only work on direct children of the flex or grid component. This means that if you have variable amounts of content, the card will stretch to the height of the grid area or flex container. Any content inside uses regular block layout, meaning that on a card with less content the footer will rise up to the bottom of the content rather than stick to the bottom of the card.  To solve this problem, go to file push-footer-down.html-->
